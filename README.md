# Gridiron GM Unity Project

This repository contains a lightweight Unity frontend for Gridiron GM. Rosters and league information are loaded from a `league_state.json` file generated by the backend.

## Generating League Data
A helper script is provided to create a sample league with random players. Run the following command from the repository root:

```bash
python scripts/generate_league_state.py
```

This writes `save/league_state.json`, which the Unity UI will read on startup.

## Roster Preview in Team Selection
The **TeamSelection** screen now shows a scrollable roster preview when you select a team. Make sure the scene references `PlayerRow` and the roster content object in the inspector.
